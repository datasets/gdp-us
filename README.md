an annual and quarterly basis. Annual data is provided since 1930 and quarterly
data since 1947. Both total GDP (levels) and annualized percentage change in
GDP are provided. Both levels and changes are available both in current dollars

## Data

The calculation of GDP and, in particular, chained measures of GDP involves
some complexities. You can read more about the benefits and issues of BEA's
